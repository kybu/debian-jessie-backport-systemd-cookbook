debian-jessie-backport-systemd cookbook
=======================================

This cookbook can be used to create .deb systemd packages backported from Debian testing to Debian Jessie (8.2).

The cookbook is NOT MEANT to be 'cooked' on your live Debian installation. Rather, it should be 'cooked' on freshly installed Debian Jessie in a virtual machine or container.
